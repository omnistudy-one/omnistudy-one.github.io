# Instructions for OmniStudy Landing Website

Please design and build a modern, high-converting landing page for the **OmniStudy** iOS app (formerly Doc2Quiz).

## 1. Project Overview
**App Name**: OmniStudy

**Target Audience**: Students, lifelong learners, and professionals preparing for exams or needing to master content quickly.
**Platform**: iOS (iPhone) only.

## 2. Design Aesthetic
- **Style**: Clean, modern, and academic yet vibrant. Think "Apple Design" meets "Headspace" or "Notion".
